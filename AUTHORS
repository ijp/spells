In the following, all top-level libraries included in spells are
listed grouped by their authors. All the R6RS library wrappers were
written by Andreas Rottmann; I do not note this explicitly below, just
considering actual code, not the interface provided by the .sls files.

For more information (including licenses), please refer to the
corresponding files.
