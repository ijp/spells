* Language facilities

- spells.opt-args

   Do we really need to have so many optional argument macros (except
   to support legacy code?). Actually, inside spells, I'll forbid use
   of anything except DEFINE/OPTIONAL-ARGS.

o [rotty] Operating system interface

This needs a restructuring; I have the following in mind:

- spells.process

   Proper documentation and more tests needed.

- spells.filesys

   Documentation, tests missing.

* Text-related

- spells.ascii

   Make clear that "ascii" can in fact be an unspecified
   extension of ASCII (i.e. Latin-1 for Scheme 48).

* Documentation

Documentation is missing for these structures:

match, define-values, cells, weak, byte-vectors, blobs, pretty-print,
bitwise, block-io, process
