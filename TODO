* Language facilities

- spells.opt-args: Clean up.

  There's no need to have so many optional argument macros (except to
  support legacy code).

* Operating system interface

- spells.file: Rework, based on Riastradh's filesys proposal.
- spells.file-list: Remove?
- spells.pathname: Implement, based on Riastradh's pathname proposal.

* Text-related

- spells.ascii

   Make clear that "ascii" can in fact be an unspecified
   extension of ASCII (i.e. Latin-1 for Scheme 48).

* Documentation

Documentation is missing for these structures:

match, define-values, cells, weak, byte-vectors, blobs, pretty-print,
bitwise, block-io, process
