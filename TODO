* Language facilities

- spells.opt-args

   Do we really need to have so many optional argument macros (except
   to support legacy code?). Actually, inside spells, I'll forbid use
   of anything except DEFINE/OPTIONAL-ARGS.

o [rotty] Operating system interface

This needs a restructuring; I have the following in mind:

- spells.filesys

  Implement, based on Riastradh's filesys proposal.

- spells.file

   This should eventually go away. As a temporary measure, until
   pathnames are ready (I want to wait for Riastradh's T stuff), move
   the namestring-related parts to spells.namestring; then
   spells.filesys + spells.namestring should be able to replace
   spells.file, modulo some library-level procedures, which should be
   added to spells.filesys.

- spells.file-list

   Remove; lift into conjure.

* Text-related

- spells.ascii

   Make clear that "ascii" can in fact be an unspecified
   extension of ASCII (i.e. Latin-1 for Scheme 48).

* Documentation

Documentation is missing for these structures:

match, define-values, cells, weak, byte-vectors, blobs, pretty-print,
bitwise, block-io, process
