* Before release

*** TODO Check README

Ensure that instructions in README work as advertised.

*** TODO Clarify licensing

List all authors an used licenses, and the respective files, at least.

*** TODO Improve documentation

Documentation should at least be sufficient to make spells usable for
other people without poking around in the source tree.

This depends on getting stexidoc up to speed again.

*** TODO Make spells more self-contained

Currently, besides the xitomatl SRFIs (which are a dependency to stay,
as there's no sense in duplicating the code inside the spells source
tree), spells depends also on (xitomatl include). This can be easily
fixed by including the needed (tiny bit of) code.

Also, spells should contain a testing framework, and stop depending on
testeez, which is kind of inflexible anyway. This task includes:

- Finishing up the R6RS adaption of Riastradh's testing framework, and
  include it into spells.

*** TODO Investigate testsuite errors

There's a bug in the streams.scm tests on Ypsilon. Probably a Ypsilon
bug.

* Things to think about

- spells.opt-args

   Do we really need to have so many optional argument macros (except
   to support legacy code?). Actually, inside spells, I think I'll
   forbid use of anything except DEFINE/OPTIONAL-ARGS.
